The only real purpose for this blog is a place for me to note down technical thoughts and anything interesting that I come across while designing and writing software.

The site is generated using Jekyll which I'm running on Windows (under the Linux Subsystem). It was surprisingly easy to get running following the [Quickstart][jekyll-qs], although I found that I had to sudo a lot of commands which the instructions said I shouldn't have to, so I suspect that I might have a slightly janky install as a result of that. Doesn't seem to have caused any problems so far though.

Using the Linux Subsystem makes it fairly easy to install and run Ruby for Jekyll, while storing the git repo in a place that is accessible to Windows Applications, so I can use VSCode to edit the blog.

Since I only really want a place to write things that I find interesting, or might want to refer back to in the future, a static site works perfectly for me and was super easy to setup.
